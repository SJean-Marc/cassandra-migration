# Cassandra Migration

`cassandra-migration` is a simple and lightweight Apache Cassandra database schema migration tool.

It is a Kotlin fork of [Contrast Security's Cassandra Migration] project, which has been manually re-based to closely follow [Axel Fontaine / BoxFuse Flyway] project.
 
It is designed to work similar to Flyway, supporting plain CQL and Java-based migrations. Both CQL execution and Java migration interface uses [DataStax's Cassandra Java driver].

### Limitations

**The tool does not roll back the database upon migration failure.** You're expected to manually restore from backup.
